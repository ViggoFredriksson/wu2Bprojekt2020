            <h2>The track itself - The velodrome</h2>
            <p>
                The track, called a velodrome, is a purpose-built bicycle racing
                arena. Modern velodromes have standardized measurements,
                consisting of two 180-degree bends connected my two straghts.
                The bends are steeply banked, but transition into the not so
                steep straights.

                    So you can go faster! With the curves of the track being

                    The velodrome featurs multiple colored lines that go all the
                    way around the track. These lines are usually laid out
                    in a specific way.Between the infield and the track itself
                    lies the blue "cote d'azur".This is not a part of the track,
                    and riding on it to overtake a competitor will disqualify you.
                    20 cm above the "cote d'azur" lies the black measurment line,
                    which defines the track length. If Olympic or World
                    Championship events are to be held at a velodrome, the measuring
                    line, and thus also the track itself, must be the standard
                    250 m. The black line also indicates the optimal route for
                    a track cyclist to take around the track, as it would be the shortest.
                    5 cm above the measuring line is the red sprinter's line.
                    Between the sprinter's line and the measuring line is the
                    sprinters lane. A rider in the sprinter's lane may not be
                    passed on the inside. At the middle of the track's width
                    is the blue stayer's line. This line is used in races in which
                    motorbikes are used for pacing. During such events, the
                    motorbike may not be overtaken on the inside of this line.
