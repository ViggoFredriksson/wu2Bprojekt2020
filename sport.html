            <p>
                Track cycling is a bicycle racing sport. The races are usually held at banked tracks
                called velodromes.

                    Track cycling is a fairly old sport and existed as early as 1870, if not earlier.
                    Since the start of track cycling, the races have always been held on velodromes,
                    although the tracks weren't standardized like they are today. The most notable
                    historical change in track cycling are the bikes, being far lighter and more
                    aerodynamic today, compared to what they used to be. Same goes with the
                    other equipment that track cyclists use.

                    While track cycling is nowhere near as popular as road
                    cycling, it's not tiny either. It's probably most popular
                    in Europeian countries such as Belgium, France, Germany and
                    the United Kingdom. There track cycling is often used as a
                    means to off season training for road-racers, who also
                    ride the track professionally. The sport would probably be
                    more popular if it was more accesssible, but that would
                    require there to be more velodromes around the world.
