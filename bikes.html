            <h2>About the track bicycle</h2>
            <p>If you're new to track cycling, you might think that a track bike isn't to
                different from any other bike, but you'd be wrong. A track bicycle differs from
                other bicycles in some very significant ways.</p>

                    Track bicycles use a so called fixed gear drivetrain. It means that as long as the
                    wheels of the bike are spinning, so are the pedals. This is because fixed gear bikes
                    lack a freewheel. A freewheel of some kind is present on almost all bikes, and allows
                    the rider to "coast", or stop pedaling while the bike is still rolling. This is
                    is impossible to do on a fixed gear bicycle, as the rear sprocket, is directly connected
                    to the wheel. Fixed gear bikes also lack, well, gears. If you want to go faster, you
                    simply have to pedal faster. This isn't much of a problem, since there are no hills in
                    the velodrome (the track).

                <img class="tripple-art-img" src="img/cockpit1.jpg" alt="Picture of a track bicycle, with focus on the handlebars">
                <p class="tripple-art-text">
                    If you are familiar with what the cockpit of a road bike looks like, you'll see that
                    the bike in the picture above lacks brake levers. It might seem like madness, but
                    even though many track cyclist ride at speeds of 60 km/h or more, track bikes don't
                    have any brakes. The only way to stop a track bike is to backpedal, but when you're
                    moving at the speeds of an experienced track cyclist, going from full speed to standing
                    still takes a very long time. There is also the fact that there isn't much of a need
                    to be able to stop quickly, as focus is on going faster than your opponent.

                <p class="tripple-art-text">
                    Using track bikes on the street was originally popularized by bicycle messengers.
                    Messengers appreciated the simplicity of the track bike, as it meant it wasn't Very
                    prone to have mechanical issues. Having no brakes, track bikes were also less appealing
                    to steal, meaning a messenger could feel reasonably safe leaving their bike unattended
                    while picking up or dropping off a package. Nowadays, using fixed gear bikes on the
                    street is quite popular. Some people equip their fixed gear bikes with breaks with flat
                    handlebars and brakes, to make them better suited for street riding. These are sometimes
                    refered to as tarck bikes, as a lighthearted way of mocking them for not being true
                    track bicycles.
