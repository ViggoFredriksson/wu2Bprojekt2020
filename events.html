            <h2>The different race formats</h2>
            <p>
                There are two broader categories of race formats: sprint races and endurance
                races. The main sprint events are as follows: sprint, team sprint,
                keirin and time trial. The main endurance formats are: Individual pursuit,
                team pursuit, madison, scratch race, points race and omnium.

                    each other, but sprint itself doesn't necessarily begin at
                    the starting line. By going slow in the beginning, the riders
                    attempt to trick their opponent into making the first move,
                    allowing them to draft their opponent, to gain an aerodynamic
                    advantage. This advantage lets them save energy, making it easier
                    to overtake in time to cross the finish line first.

                    Despite its name, the team sprint is not a regular cycling

                    or a two-woman event over two laps.
